# cluedo-js
A JavaScript-based Cluedo game that uses node.js, p5.js, and socket.io. 
To play, download the project and run the Node server. Connect to the Node webserver using a web-browser (I recommend Firefox) and click "new game". Each server instance contains one lobby for one game.
This is a project in an alpha stage of development, I do not recommend anyone use it in its current state.
