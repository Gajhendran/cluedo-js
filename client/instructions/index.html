    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Click play game and load the lobby. Click ready game when you are ready to play. When all the players are ready, the game will begin and no one else will be allowed to join the game from there-on.</p>
    <p>At the start of the game, three cards are randomly chosen by the server and stored in an "envelope". There is one suspect card, one weapon card, and one room card. The objective of the game is to work out what these cards are.</p>
    <p>Each player is given an certain number of cards. Because you have your cards, you know they aren't in the envelope.</p>
    <p>You can deduce which cards are in the envelope by making suggestions to other players. You make one suggestion scenario consisting of three cards, and the first player around the table who has at least one of those cards picks one to show you. Because you see another players card, you know it's not in the envelope. However, other players can use your suggestions to get a better idea of what's inside the envelope also.</p>
    <p>You can only make an suggestion if you are in a room you wish to suggest. You get around the board with dice rolls.</p>
    <p>When you feel like you have a good idea of what's inside the envelope, you can make an accusation. If you get it right you win! But if just one card is wrong, you lose. You will still be in the game to share your cards with others, but you will no longer be able to make new suggestions or accusations yourself.</p>
    <p>Have fun!</p>
